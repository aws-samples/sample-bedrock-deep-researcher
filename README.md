# AI-Powered Article Generation with Bedrock Deep Research

Bedrock Deep Research is a Streamlit-based application that automates article generation through AI-powered research, content writing, and image generation. It combines web research, structured content generation, and human feedback to produce comprehensive, well-researched articles with accompanying header images (generated by Amazon Bedrock Nova).

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 (to install, visit this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   Check your python version using `python --version`.
   If your global python isn't set as `3.12`, follow the steps here: https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/)
- Poetry for dependency management
- [AWS Bedrock access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html) for LLM inference.

## Setup

The setup is meant to be used locally with [AWS authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-authentication-short-term.html), as well as within Amazon Sagemaker: either in [JupyterLab](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-updated-jl.html) or [Code Editor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/code-editor.html) instance.

### 1. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-deep-research.git
cd bedrock-deep-research

# Install dependencies using Poetry
poetry install

# Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell
```

### 2. Create and set your Tavily API key

Go to https://app.tavily.com/home and create an API KEY for free. Copy the API Key and paste it into the `env.tmp` file.

### 3. Setup the environment variables

Copy the environment variables into the local environment.
```
cp env.tmp .env
```

### 4. Run the application

- Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run bedrock_deep_research.py
```

- In the web interface:
   - Enter your article topic
   - Specify writing guidelines
   - Configure search parameters
   - Click "Generate Outline"

- Review and provide feedback on the outline:
   - Submit feedback to refine the outline
   - Accept the outline to proceed with full article generation

- Once complete:
   - Review the generated article with header image
   - Copy to clipboard or start a new article

### More Detailed Examples

**Custom Writing Guidelines Example:**
```text
- Strict 150-200 word limit
- Start with your most important insight in **bold**
- Include code examples where relevant
- Focus on practical implementation
```

**Web Research Configuration:**
```python
number_of_queries = 3  # Number of search queries per section
max_search_depth = 2   # Maximum research iterations per section
```

**Debug Mode:**
```bash
# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
streamlit run bedrock_deep_research.py
```

## Data Flow
The application follows a sequential workflow from topic input to final article generation, with feedback loops for refinement.

```ascii
[Topic Input] -> [Initial Research] -> [Outline Generation] -> [Human Feedback]
                      |                       |                      |
                      v                       v                      v
              [Web Research] <- [Section Writing] <- [Outline Refinement]
                      |                |                     |
                      v                v                     v
              [Content Review] -> [Final Assembly] -> [Image Generation]
```

Key Component Interactions:
- InitialResearcher performs web searches to gather context
- ArticleOutlineGenerator creates structured outline using research data
- HumanFeedbackProvider enables interactive refinement
- SectionWriter generates content with web research integration
- ArticleHeadImageGenerator creates relevant header images
- Final compilation combines all elements into cohesive article
