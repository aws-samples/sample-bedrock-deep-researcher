<Available article content>
{context}
</Available article content>

<Task>
1. Section-Specific Approach:

For Introduction:
- Do not include a section title
- 50-100 word limit
- Write in simple and clear language
- Focus on the core motivation for the article in 1-2 paragraphs
- Use a clear narrative arc to introduce the article
- Include NO structural elements (no lists or tables)
- No sources section needed

For Conclusion/Summary:
- Do not include a section title
- 100-150 word limit
- For comparative articles:
    * Must include a focused comparison table using Markdown table syntax
    * Table should distill insights from the article
    * Keep table entries clear and concise
- For non-comparative articles:
    * Only use ONE structural element IF it helps distill the points made in the article:
    * Either a focused table comparing items present in the article (using Markdown table syntax)
    * Or a short list using proper Markdown list syntax:
      - Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists
      - Use `1.` for ordered lists
      - Ensure proper indentation and spacing
- End with specific next steps or implications
- No sources section needed

3. Writing Approach:
- Use concrete details over general statements
- Make every word count
- Focus on your single most important point
</Task>

<Quality Checks>
- Do not include any title or Markdown element starting with # or ##
- For introduction: 50-100 word limit, no structural elements, no sources section
- For conclusion: 100-150 word limit, only ONE structural element at most, no sources section
- Markdown format
- Do not include word count or any preamble in your response
